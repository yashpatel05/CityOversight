# City Oversight

## Overview
The **City Oversight** project aims to contribute to the development of smart and clean cities by implementing modules for garbage detection and pothole detection. These modules utilize technologies such as machine learning and image processing to enhance city management and improve road safety.

## Modules
1. **Garbage Detection:**
   - Supports the idea of a clean city and garbage automation.
   - Allows users to report instances of garbage by capturing and submitting images.
   - Automates the process of reporting to the respective municipal authorities.

2. **Pothole Detection:**
   - Supports the idea of road safety, a crucial aspect of smart cities.
   - Enables users to report potholes by capturing and submitting images.
   - Facilitates the efficient handling of pothole reports by municipal authorities.

## User Interfaces
1. **Admin:**
   - Manages all aspects of the system, including cameras, reports, users, employees, and technicians.

2. **Citizen:**
   - Can report instances of garbage and potholes by submitting images.
   - Can view the cleanliness status of different areas and track the resolution of reported issues.

3. **Employee:**
   - Can manually capture images of garbage and potholes for reporting.
   - Facilitates the submission of reports to the respective municipal authorities.

4. **Technician:**
   - Responsible for managing cameras, including installation and repair.
   - Activates camera statuses and performs related maintenance tasks.

## Model Training File
- To enhance the functionality of the modules, a model training file is required. You can download the file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j382feHvJXYXLdwXINqgEHTQlAqGiDEY/view?usp=drive_link).
- After downloading, unzip the file and place it in the `CityOversight\CityWebsite\object_detection` folder.
